I'm Matlhatse (Saadiyah), a student on a journey to learn coding and explore the vast world of technology.

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing a BA in International Relations, but my passion for technology has led me to dive into the world of coding. I'm fascinated by web development and have recently embarked on learning it. Additionally, I have a keen interest in data science, and I aspire to merge my knowledge of international relations with programming skills to make a positive impact.

## Skills

While I'm still early in my coding journey, here are some skills I'm developing:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Python (beginner)
- Data Analysis (beginner)

## Projects

Here are some future projects I'm working on:

1. [Web Development Blog]- A blog where I release articles on various topics. I've made modifications and edits to the code and self-publish articles as a freelance writer.
The purpose of this blog is to reach an audience interested in the intersection of technology, politics, and global affairs, leveraging my knowledge in international relations and programming skills.

2. [Data Analysis Project]- Exploring International Relations Data

This project focuses on analyzing datasets related to international relations topics. The goal is to leverage my knowledge in international relations and data analysis skills to explore and interpret data in meaningful ways.
